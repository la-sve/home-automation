# home-automation

As I don't believe, this project is of much relevance to others, it is described only in german. It is about my personal home automation using a lot of DS18S20 temperature sensors distributed within every room in my home for controlling my heating system via custom made DS2408 boards connected to some finder relais switching the underfloor heating on and of for individual rooms. Additionally, light switches (push buttons) are used as input to another part of the DS2408 boards to be able to use them normally besides the automation over _Home Assistant_. The later is used for automation and as user interface. Also a shutter control is realized, but with custom boards using an i2c port expander (MCP23017).

**Kurzbeschreibung:** Projektdateien zur Automatisierung eines Hauses mittels Home Assistant, RaspPi und diversen Sensoren und Aktoren auf 1-Wire Basis.
